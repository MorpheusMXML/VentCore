# Example Project

This repository will house your application (`./app`), as well as the deliverables for the course (`./deliverables`).

Please note that all of your application code must live within the "App" folder above, including the custom "README.md" file you will create for your application. This README will remain as a guide for future visitors to this repository. Feel free to customise it.
