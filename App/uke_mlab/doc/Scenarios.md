# Scenario Topic

This topic resembles the classes needed to use the scenario data provided for the UKE project. We differentiate between the patient scenario (provided by the UKE project) and a standard scenario which houses the standard demonstration for the functionalities of the app. To change the Data feed into these scenarios please have a look at:

```bash
../assets/jsons
```

These jsons hold all the differens sensor channels and feed corresponding data to the graphs and absolute value tiles.
