# DataModels Topic

The models within this topic represent the runtime data that is handeled within the app. For example a DataModelNIBD is responsible for handling the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure datapoints.
The datamodel also provides the graphs and absolute value tiles with their corresponding data. The datamodels are deeply connected with the sensor enum identifiers. These identifiers allow to specify differen sensor data streams into the application.
